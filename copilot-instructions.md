These are assistant guidance files used when iterating on the project.

Keep the starter focused on fast first loads and progressive enhancement:
- Lazy-load heavy SDKs (map, weather) when user opens the map or requests details
- Keep the initial JS small and unobtrusive
- Add accessibility helpers and keyboard navigation early
